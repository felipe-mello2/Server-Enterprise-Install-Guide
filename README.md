**ABOUT**

LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) and Windows Server editions are streamlined versions of Windows that focus on stability and long-term support.
They receive no feature updates, only security updates, and are supported for up to 10 years.
These editions are designed to minimize bloat, making them ideal for enterprise environments and servers where stability and security are prioritized over new features.
